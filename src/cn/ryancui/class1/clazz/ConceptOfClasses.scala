/**
  * It should be noted that the return type of these two methods is not given explicitly.
  * It will be inferred automatically by the compiler, which looks at the right-hand side of these methods and deduces
  * that both return a value of type Double.
  *
  * The compiler is not always able to infer types like it does here, and there is unfortunately no simple rule to know
  * exactly when it will be, and when not. In practice, this is usually not a problem since the compiler complains
  * when it is not able to infer a type which was not given explicitly.
  * As a simple rule, beginner Scala programmers should try to omit type declarations which seem to be easy to deduce from the context,
  * and see if the compiler agrees. After some time, the programmer should get a good feeling about when to omit types,
  * and when to specify them explicitly.

/**
  * It would be nicer to be able to access the real and imaginary parts like if they were fields, without putting the empty pair of parenthesis.
  * This is perfectly doable in Scala, simply by defining them as methods without arguments.
  * Such methods differ from methods with zero arguments in that they donâ€™t have parenthesis after their name,
  * neither in their definition nor in their use. Our Complex class can be rewritten as follows:
